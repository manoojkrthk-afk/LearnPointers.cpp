ðŸ”— Understanding Pointers in C++

Pointers are one of the most powerful and fundamental features in C++. Although they may seem complex at first, once you understand how they work, they become an essential tool for building efficient and flexible programs.

ðŸ“Œ What is a Pointer?

A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.

Instead of holding a value directly (like int a = 10;), a pointer holds the location in memory where the value is stored.

ðŸ”§ Basic Pointer Syntax
int a = 10;       // A regular integer variable
int *ptr = &a;    // A pointer to an int, storing the address of 'a'


*ptr is a pointer to an int.

&a means "address of a".

*ptr (dereferencing) gives the value stored at that address.

ðŸ§ª Example 1: Basic Pointer Usage
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a = 42;
    int *ptr = &a;

    cout << "Value of a: " << a << endl;              // 42
    cout << "Address of a: " << &a << endl;           // Memory address
    cout << "Value of ptr: " << ptr << endl;          // Same address as &a
    cout << "Value pointed by ptr: " << *ptr << endl; // 42

    return 0;
}

ðŸ“Œ Pointer Terminology
Term	Meaning
* (asterisk)	Declares a pointer and dereferences it
& (ampersand)	Gets the address of a variable
ptr	Pointer variable (holds an address)
*ptr	Dereferenced pointer (gets value at address)
ðŸ§ª Example 2: Modifying Value via Pointer
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void modify(int *p) {
    *p = *p + 10;  // Modify value at the address
}

int main() {
    int num = 5;
    modify(&num);
    cout << "Modified num: " << num << endl;  // Output: 15
}


Since p points to num, modifying *p changes the original variable.

ðŸ“Œ Null Pointers

A null pointer is a pointer that does not point to any memory location.

int *ptr = nullptr;


Always initialize pointers. Using uninitialized pointers can cause undefined behavior.

ðŸ“Œ Pointer to Pointer

You can also have a pointer that stores the address of another pointer.

int a = 10;
int *p = &a;
int **pp = &p;

cout << **pp << endl;  // Output: 10

ðŸ“Œ Common Pointer Use Cases

Dynamic memory allocation (new, delete)

Arrays and strings

Function arguments (pass by pointer)

Data structures (linked lists, trees, etc.)

Interfacing with low-level hardware or APIs
